# Mooore stylelint-config (SCSS)

Our SCSS version is little bit more strict than our [luma config version](../luma).

This uses the `@fylgja/stylelint-config/scss`,
and makes some rules trow a warning instead a error to have less strictness

_This file is mainly used for the base import with the snowdog config._
