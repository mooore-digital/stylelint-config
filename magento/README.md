# Mooore stylelint-config (Magento)

When use the Magento 2 default LESS compiler.
These are out style rules we set.

The rules focus on making some base rules less strict.
For LESS with the [@fylgja/stylelint-config](https://github.com/fylgja/stylelint-config).

This version focuses on the LESS version 2.7.1 that Magento shippes with.
Any newer version LESS is not supported.
